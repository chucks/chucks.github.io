    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my new blog <em>Cocoa Nibs</em>. I&rsquo;m still getting things set up, so expect things to change around a bit while I get back into blogging.</p>

<p>I had a personal blog hosted on Blogger for a number of years, but it was strictly a friends-and-family thingâ€“not even indexed in Google. That was fine, but it wasn&rsquo;t the sort of place where I could join the larger conversation.</p>

<p>I intend to focus somewhat on Cocoa development and related topics, hence the title. However, I&rsquo;m terrible at staying on-topic, so there is sure to be other random stuff now and then.</p>

<p>So sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight :&ndash;)</p>
